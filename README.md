- Are we going to need and  get a common Qiskit API key from you or  we should use our own?
- Is there a reason why you propose Q as buddy? (We have Gemini and others)
- It is mentioned in the expectations that we can expect job from this cohort, so can you please give a brief detail about it?
- After completing this project, what percentage can we say represents our knowledge about quantum computing? Is that enough to work in this industry?
- Would we have access to Q after the end of the course?
- What would you say to someone who isnâ€™t interested in becoming a programmer, but still wants to work in the Quantum industry? What other roles or opportunities do you see for people like that?
